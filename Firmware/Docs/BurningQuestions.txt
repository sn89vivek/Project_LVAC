1. Why does the latency not change when sending a packet with a reduced length? 
   (OR) What does a frame transmitted look like?
2. How to transmit packets globally?
3. What are the mechanisms for error correction?
4. How to establish full duplex communication?
5. How are collisions handled whem multiple nodes transmit at the same time?

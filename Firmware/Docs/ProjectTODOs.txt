1. Communicate from multiple slaves..                               (DONE)              
2. Full duplex coomunication
3. Send a global packet back to nodes
4. Send a packet addressed locally to individual nodes
5. Process commands from UART(reference) on concentrator 
   and send it downstream
6. Connect nodes to piccolo (UART best?)
7. Push data from concentrator to piccolo
8. Push data upstream from piccolo
